### Endpoints
- **GET `/wp-json/wpm/v1/capacity`**:
  - Parameters: `date`, `entity_type` (category, product, variation), `entity_id`, `persian_date` (boolean).
  - Returns: Capacity details for the specified date and entity.
- **GET `/wp-json/wpm/v1/order-items`**:
  - Parameters: `status`, `category`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `persian_date` (boolean).
  - Returns: List of order items with filters.

### Webhook
- Configure a webhook URL in the settings to receive JSON payloads for order item status changes.
- Payload includes: `event`, `order_id`, `order_item_id`, `item_name`, `old_status`, `new_status`, `delivery_date`, `order_date`, `timestamp`.

## SMS Integration
- The plugin supports SMS notifications via an external SMS provider.
- Replace the sample API URL in `src/SMS/SMS.php` with your providerâ€™s API endpoint (e.g., Kavenegar, Melipayamak).
- Example payload:
  ```json
  {
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "to": "customer_phone_number",
    "message": "Order #123 status changed to Processing."
  }
  ```

## Persian Date Support
- Dates are displayed in the Persian (Jalali) calendar by default.
- Use the `persian_date=false` parameter in API requests to get Gregorian dates.
- The plugin uses the `morilog/jalali` library for date conversions.

## Troubleshooting
- **Composer Errors**: Ensure Composer is installed and run `composer install` in the plugin directory.
- **API Authentication Issues**: Verify the API key in `WooCommerce > Production Manager > Webhook & API`.
- **SMS Not Sending**: Check the SMS provider API key and template settings. Ensure the customer has a valid phone number and SMS notifications enabled.
- **Date Issues**: Ensure the server timezone is set correctly in WordPress settings.

## Support
- **Documentation**: Available in the plugin settings under `WooCommerce > Production Manager`.
- **Issues**: Report bugs or request features via the GitHub repository (if available) or contact the developer.
